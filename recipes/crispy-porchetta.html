        <h3>Andy Cooks Crispy Porchetta</h3>
        <p>I love porchetta - the Italian pork 
            roast! You have juicy pork with loads 
            of flavour and a crispy crackling on 
            the outside. It's a great dish to make 
            when you have family or friends over for 
            a meal or for your Sunday lunch. Here's 
            my porchetta recipe.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pork belly, bone out, skin on, with 
                the pork loin still attached 
                (If you can't get one, a pork belly without the loin will also work)
            </li>
            <li>4 large sprigs of rosemary, finely chopped</li>
            <li>12 cloves of garlic, grated</li>
            <li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>1 bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1tpsp (15ml) of chilli flakes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (15ml) of fennel pollen (or toasted fennel seeds)</li>
            <li>30g (about 1oz) of salt</li>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the marinade, mix everything except
                    the pork in a bowl. Leave it in the fridge until 
                    you are ready to use it.
                </li>
                <li>To prepare the pork, start by rolling it to see where 
                    the skin overlaps. Trim the skin back to that point, as 
                    you don't want any skin rolled on the inside.
                </li>
                <li>Next, remove the loin by following the seam. Then, butterfly the loin 
                    by running your knife down the middle and on each side to open it up.
                    Add about 1/4 of the marinade and set it aside, ready to be marinated and rolled.
                </li>
                <li>To prepare the belly part, start by scoring the skin in the opposite direction to 
                    how the string will be tied. A razor blade is ideal, but a sharpe knife works too.
                    Next, cut deep score lines into the flesh side for the marinade to penetrate.
                </li>
                <li>Rub the rest of the marinade into the belly part thoroughly</li>
                <li>Place the loin back onto the belly and roll the belly over the loin 
                    Tie the porchetta, working from the centre outwards as tightly as possible. 
                    Then, place it on an oven tray with a rack and leave it uncovered in the fridge 
                    for 24 to 48 hours.
                </li>
                <li>When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 225C (445F). Cook the porchetta at this temperature for 
                    40-45 minutes, then turn the oven down to 140C (285F) and cook until the internal temperature 
                    reaches 70C (170F). This will take about 3 hours, but it's best to start checking around 1.5 hours 
                    into the cooking time.
                </li>
                <li>Once the internal temperature reaches 75C, remove the porchetta and let it rest for 20-30 minutes before 
                    carving and serving. If it's cooked quicker than anticipated, you can leave it to rest longer and then 
                    briefly place it back in the oven to bring the exterior back to temperature.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
